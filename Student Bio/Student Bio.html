        <p>Hi! My name is Luigi, and I am a student of the UCB Coding Bootcamp. I enjoy cars and video games. I love to work on my cars when I have the time (and money). They are my babies!
            </br>I'm taking this class because I have had an interest in coding for a while, and I thought this would be a quick way to develop my coding skills.
            </br>I am currently working in Biotech, and do enjoy my job, but I want to get that code developer skrilla, you feel?
            </br>My dream is to one day get into big data, especially in biotech - where deep learning algorithms and data processing are becoming increasingly important.
            </br>This should be a difficult, yet exciting, 6 months.
        </p>
